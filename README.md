# Setup

## Elastic Search

Create a common network so that other services can connect to Elastic Search. eg: Kibana
```shell
docker network create elastic-search-network
```

Make sure you have elastic search image (elastic search doesn't have latest tag)
```shell
docker pull elasticsearch:8.1.2
```

Start Elasticsearch container
```shell
docker run -d --name elasticsearch --net elastic-search-network -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:8.1.2
```

**Setting up passwords**

Since the log might not be visible for us in detach mode the elastic seach is not auto generating passwords.

For setting up all the passwords manually.
```shell
docker exec -it elasticsearch ./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
```
For generating random passwords
```shell
docker exec -it elasticsearch ./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto
```

<br>

**Verify the connection**

For checking if you are able to access the elasticseach container
```shell
curl -u elastic:password https://localhost:9200 -k
```
here, `-k` means insecure via https, `elastic` (there are other users as well) is the username `password` is the password set in previous step.

*or* 

Find certificate location

```shell
docker exec -it elasticsearch /bin/bash -c "find /usr/share/elasticsearch -name http_ca.crt"
```

copy it to the host system
```shell
docker cp elasticsearch:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs/http_ca.crt .
```

and then curl
```shell
curl --cacert http_ca.crt -u elastic https://localhost:9200
```

### Generating enrollment token for connecting with kibana

```shell
docker exec elasticsearch ./bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token --scope kibana
```

## Kibana
Make sure you have kibana image (same as elastic search doesn't have latest tag)
```shell
docker pull kibana:8.1.2
```

Create kibana on same network as elastic search container
```shell
docker run -d --name kibana --net elastic-search-network -p 5601:5601 kibana:8.1.2
```

**Verification code**

Once you verity Kibana with token. You will be asked for verification code. You can get verification code using.
```shell
docker exec kibana ./bin/kibana-verification-code
```

**Docker commands**

To execute the containers in the detach mode
```shell
docker-compose -f elk_kafka_compose.yaml up -d
```

To terminate all the containers
```shell
docker-compose -f elk_kafka_compose.yaml down
```

To view the list of docker containers running
```shell
docker-compose ps
```

To view the logs in tail fashion with container name
```shell
docker-compose logs kibana -f
```
